# Rename Images as Auxiliary

When i was an auxiliary in the Universidad del Quindio (Q3-Q4 of 2022), i had to create a semanal report with 6-9 images per hour. But the image names weren't organised, so I created a python code that changes the name of all the image files of a directory to something I can understand easier

I had to put per week a total of 51 images so the code helped me too much
